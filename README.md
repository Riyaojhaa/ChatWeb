🚀 Just wanted to learn how real-time communication works, so I built a simple chat application using Socket.IO, Node.js, and Vanilla JavaScript!

💬 It lets users send and receive messages instantly using WebSockets — no page reloads, just real-time updates ⚡

🔧 Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express
Real-time: Socket.IO

🔍 Through this project, I learned:

#How WebSocket connections work under the hood
#How to use Socket.IO to emit and receive messages between client and server
#The basics of building a backend with Node and Express
#Structuring a real-time feature from scratch

🛠 There’s still a lot I want to improve — like storing chats in MySQL, adding authentication, and enhancing the UI.

📣 Would love to get your feedback, suggestions, or tips to help me grow!
